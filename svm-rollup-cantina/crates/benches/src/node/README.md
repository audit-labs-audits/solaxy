# Native Benchmarks
Native benchmarks refer to the performance of the rollup SDK in native mode - this does not involve proving
## Methodology
* We use the Bank module's Transfer call as the main transaction for running this benchmark. So what we're measuring is the number of value transfers that can be done per second. 
* We do not connect to the DA layer since that will be the bottleneck if we do. We pre-populate 20 blocks (configurable via env var BLOCKS) with 1 blob each containing 100 transactions each (configurable via env var TXNS_PER_BLOCK). 
* The first block contains a "CreateToken" and "Mint" transactions.
* All token transfers are initiated from the created token's mint address

```
* **rollup_coarse_measure.rs**
  * This script uses coarse grained timers (with std::time) to measure the time taken to process all the pre-generated blocks.
  * We can control the number of blocks and transactions per block with environment variables
  * There are timers around the main loop for a total measurement, as well as timers around key functions
    * begin_slot
    * apply_blob
    * end_slot
  * The script uses rust lib prettytable-rs to format the output in a readable way
  * Optionally, the script also allows generating prometheus metrics (histogram), so they can be aggregated by other tools.

# Makefile
We abstract having to manually run the benchmarks by using a Makefile for the common benchmarks we want to run

The Makefile is located in the demo-rollup/benches folder and supports the following commands
* **make basic** - supports the coarse grained timers (getting the TPS) using rollup_coarse_measure.rs
* **make flamegraph** - runs `cargo flamegraph`. On mac this requires `sudo` permissions. The script ensures some cleanup and to err on the side of caution, it deletes the `sovereign/target` folder since new artifacts can be owned by root

The Makefile supports setting number of blocks and transactions per block using BLOCKS and TXNS_PER_BLOCK env vars. Defaults are 100 blocks and 10,000 transactions per block when using the Makefile
