    /// ## How it Works
    ///
    /// Ths Sovereign SDK invokes this function exactly once for each block produced on the DA layer. A "slot" is a block on the DA layer.
    /// Reorgs on the underlying DA chain are handled externally by the Sovereign SDK, and it's the job of this function to implement a "pure"
    /// state transition from its inputs to its outputs.
    ///
    /// This *implementation* of `apply_slot` has two key units of transition: a "slot", which causes bookkeeping changes to the rollup state that are not *primarily*
    /// intended to be user facing, and a "rollup block", a state transition in user space which involves processing some batches of transactions. Every single DA layer block
    /// causes a "slot" to be processed, and each slot contains either zero or one "rollup block".
    ///
    /// Since we're buidling "sovereign" rollups which don't rely on external smart contracts, the rollup has to keep track of all the data that appears on the DA layer in order
    /// to enforce censorship resistance. But, we still want sequencers to be able to give out "soft-confirmations" *before* transactions are finalized on the DA layer. This
    /// requires that we have some mechanism to prevent minor changes on the DA layer from impacting the outcome of transactions. We do this by partitioning the state
    /// into two spaces. "Kernel" state contains an exact record of all the DA layer data from the moment it appears on the DA layer, while "User" state contains the
    /// the state created by transactions. During transaction processing, all user state is visible, but access to "kernel" state is restricted to data older than some
    /// "visible" rollup height. This "visible" height is set by the "preferred" sequencer, and corresponds to the height of the latest DA layer block that the preferred
    /// sequencer had seen at the time he built each batch of transactions (assuming the preferred sequencer is honest). For security, we constrain the "visible" height
    /// to be no more than some constant ("DEFERRED_SLOTS_COUNT") behind the "true" slot number.
    ///
    /// ## Divergences Between Native and Non-Native Execution
    ///
    /// The native and non-native execution paths diverge in the `apply_slot` method in only a small handfull of places. These divergences need to be carefully
    /// audited when making changes to this code, because all reads or writes to state must be done in exactly the same order in both execution paths in order to
    /// generate the correct witness.  (Exception: Accessory state may be read or written anywhere in native code without a corresponding access in non-native code).
    ///
    /// - Metrics are not tracked or emitted in non-native mode. (Note: The vast majority of #[cfg] gates in this module are related to metrics tracking)
    /// - Events are not emitted in non-native mode.
    /// - The `FinalizeHook` is not invoked in non-native mode
